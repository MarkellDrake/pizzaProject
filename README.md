Additional Requirements

Data Persistence: Implement a solution that stores data in a persistent manner, ensuring that data remains available across page refreshes and revisits. The data storage solution should not rely solely on local storage mechanisms (like browser local storage), but should instead use a server-side or cloud-based database to maintain state.

Automated Test Suite: Submissions that include an automated test suite covering key functionalities will be given preference. Please document how to execute these tests in your project's README.

Code Quality: Submissions will be evaluated primarily on the quality of the code produced. This includes aspects such as readability, maintainability, and best practices.

User Interface: While we are not evaluating your design skills, we are looking for a functional and easy-to-use interface. Please ensure that the user interface is easy to use and intuitive. Bonus points for responsive design.

Deployment: Deploy your application to a cloud provider of your choice (e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure, Heroku, Netlify, Vercel, etc.). The deployed application should be publicly accessible.

Documentation: Include a README file that contains detailed instructions on how to build, test, and run your application locally. Also include a section in the README file that provides a brief overview of the application and your thought process behind your technical choices.
