# Project Overview

Welcome to Pizza Parrys where imagination meets a good pizza. No topping is off limits just add a topping and 

its garunteed it will be on your pizza.

In the Pizza Parrys application I went with the usage of checkboxes for each topping just to make sure  the user 

is aware of their combinations before they confirm the pizza. Once that pizza is confirmed then it is added to a 

list of pizzas  that has a few of our specialties on it. No worries if those arent the pizzas that are wanted  we 

have lovely delete buttons that not only remove  the  preset pizzas, but also if those toppings are looking too 

regular or  you cant stand the sight of them then you can delete those as well. Last but not least  we know that 

every once in a while a person might not be too sure what type of pizza they want and might want to change their  

mind, so thats why that edit button is there to add toppings or remove toppings with just a click of 

the checkbox and save button and just like that  the pizza is saved like nothing happened. One last thing to 

increase imaginative pizza making there is no doubling of the same pizza toppings or even the same type of pizza 

order. Again welcome to Pizza Parrys and remember its not as fun eating the pizzas if they arent just how you 

like it.
